This sidebar widget provides a list of authors, with options including showing recent posts by that author.

== Description ==

This sidebar widget provides a list of authors, with options including showing recent posts by that author. This is based on the plugins [WP-Authors](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-authors/) and [Recent Posts](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/recent-posts/).

The options are as follows:

Title: - Like most widgets, there is an option for a custom title.

Show post counts - Shows the total post count next to the authors name.

Number of recent posts to show: - When greater than 0, a sublist is displayed under an author's name with up to the set number of posts.

Show full names - Displays the authors first and last name instead of their chosen public name.

Hide empty authors - If an author has no posts, then they are not shown in the sidebar.

Exclude admin - Hides the admin from being shown in the sidebar.
